Code Club 2016

Hello Code Club members!

What Do We Do?
Meetings are full of lots of things! Most meetings start out with some lessons on programming concepts, then we will be spend some time practicing coding and making our own unique projects.

This year some possible projects will include:
Developing Webpages
Making Games
Graphic Design
Interactive Art
Robotics

What we can accomplish this year depends on a lot of factors.
Oh, and we eat a lot of snacks!

When Is It?
Code Club meetings will be held in the winter, Monday afternoon, Tuesday morning, Thursday afternoon.

What Is Our Mission?
Code Club was created to found a group of students who are literate in the world of computer programming. Last year we started with small goals, this year Code Club is aiming for fifty members, with several of those members aiming to pass the AP Computer Science test in the Spring. To get to this point will take a lot of work

Who Is It For?
The beauty of Code Club is it is for everyone! Regardless of what field you want to go into in the future, computer programming will be involved because our whole world is tech oriented. Everyone has a lot to gain from this club.

What we expect from you?
Work hard when you come to meetings, and when you aren't there. If you want to learn how to code you must be patient, and you must put in time outside the club meetings.
